Automatic team detection for any Bundesliga football match (March - April 2022)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Key points: Use YoloV7 for human, ball detection. Apply a sequence of classical computer vision + ML methods to detect specific jersey colors. I was able to overcome some critical challenges such as video feeds containing different lighting conditions (day / night), different colors of grass and jerseys of referees.
