During my professional career, I have gained experience working on various projects. Some of my notable experiences are:

- Google Of Investigations: Building a search engine from scratch that relates to various incident investigations in the company.
- Stability Failure Prediction: Predicting whether a product will fail in a particular test based on few past timepoints (3-5) and historical data.
- Cost of Poor Quality: Detecting the reasons behind poor quality in the manufactured batches of a drug.

These experiences have provided me with valuable insights into the workings of the industry and helped me develop my skills as a data scientist.
